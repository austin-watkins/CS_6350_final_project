are some recipes prone to failure? 


Todo: 
        figure out how to split up the data? 
                for all data
                by recipe:

notes: 
        we should use F-score
                Due to the fact that we have more good than bad

algorithms that work:
        perceptrons
        svm - Austin
        NB
        DT/RF - 
        NN - Me
        

preprocessing:
        std for DT and RF (AUSTIN)
        remove features that are not important


Let's try doing leave one out

go recipe by recipe

Formulate test set:
        we're going 25/75 split 
        

Let's see if it can predict for the other recipes?
